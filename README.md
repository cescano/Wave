# Wave

**Wave** is a community-powered app that helps people find menstrual products in their area—whether it's a local store, shelter, or a free product station submitted by another user.

> 🚧 This project is currently a work in progress. Features, design, and name are subject to change.

## 🌟 Vision

Access to menstrual products is a basic necessity—not a privilege. **Wave** aims to make finding period products easy, discreet, and community-driven, helping reduce period poverty one location at a time.

## 🩸 Key Features (Planned)

### 📍 Find Nearby Products
- **Stores** where you can buy menstrual products

- Upload a photo and description of where to find them
- All submissions go through a **moderation process** before being made public

### ✅ Moderated for Safety
- Every submission is reviewed before appearing in the app to ensure safety and accuracy

### 📴 Offline Access (Planned)
- Users will be able to:
  - **Save maps and location data** for offline use
  - Access saved listings even without Wi-Fi or cellular service
